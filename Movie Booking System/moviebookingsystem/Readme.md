# Movie Booking System

We want to create a simulation of the movie booking system for specific theatre. This system will be operated by the operator himself, he will be making booking against customer. The objective of the system is to manage the booking for multiple screens, adding shows for the screen and designing the seating arrangements as per the categories (premium, silver and gold). As per the movie booking request by the customer, operator should be able to check the availability of the seat in category choice of user. Operator should be able to get the seat availability and reports like, Collection report & shows report.
